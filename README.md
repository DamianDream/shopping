For testing purpose I configure Vite "Proxy" to reach origin FakeStore API and check list of products

How to check origin service indicated below:

- while running app just add to the url path `/api/products`
- URL example: <http://localhost:5173/api/products>

> Please be carful and check PORT before copy link below
> Vite could start server on other Localhost port if 5173 is already in use
